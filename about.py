    st.write("The use of collaborative networks is essential in the context of health innovation due to the complexity and involvement of several stakeholders in interdisciplinary research. Social network analysis (SNA) is a theoretical viewpoint and a collection of methods used to understand and quantitatively measure linkages between nodes in a network. By analyzing a network's social structure, it is possible to determine the most important nodes, create groups, and track the movement of resources. Visualization plays a crucial role in SNA, providing context for analysis. Network actors are typically represented by circles, with the size and/or color indicating their characteristics, such as centrality, nationality, and gender. Improving network visualization can increase visibility and aid analysis.")
    st.write("Bibliometrics analysis involves the application of mathematical and statistical techniques to books and other media for understanding and organising vast amounts of data. Co-authorship analysis examines patterns of collaboration between individuals and organisations. Bibliographic coupling refers to the connectivity of items based on shared references. Natural language processing (NLP) is used for automatically analysing and representing human discourse, which is useful in improving healthcare and medicine. Topic modelling, specifically LDA and LSA, is used to help classify publications into different categories or topics.")
